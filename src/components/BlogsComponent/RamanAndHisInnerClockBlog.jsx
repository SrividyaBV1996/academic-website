          This blog post is about an epoch-making event that brought to light the time-sense of a famous Nobel laureate. This blog post is about a man whose brain kept count of every passing second even with eyes closed. This blog post is about a man with an “inner” clock. This blog post is about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/C._V._Raman" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sir C. V. Raman</a>.
        </p>
        <p>
          The setting is Dharwad (or Dharwar), a district in the state of Karnataka, India, and the timeframe is 1950-60 when radio was the primary source of entertainment.
          The Dharwad station of the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/All_India_Radio" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">All India Radio</a> (AIR) aired a program for children named <em>Gilivindu</em>, meaning “a flock of parrots” in Kannada. <em>Gilivindu</em> was filled with stories that fostered the imaginative mind of children.
          Recording of <em>Gilivindu</em> sessions at the Dharwad AIR station involved identifying children from the nearby localities to take part in the recording, escorting them to the Dharwad AIR station for the recording, and dropping them off back at their respective homes safely after the recording.
        </p>
        <p>
          One evening at the Dharwad AIR station, as a few children awaited the bus that would drop them back home, <a href="https://wikitia.com/wiki/H._K._Ranganath" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Dr. H. K. Ranganath</a>, who was then the Executive Producer of the Dharwad AIR station, appeared on the scene conversing with Sir C. V. Raman. Raman was clad in a coat, a dhoti, and a turban, as was his usual dressing style, and walked alongside Ranganath with hands clasped tightly at the back.
          One of the kids in the group exclaimed, “Doesn’t he look like Sir C. V. Raman?”, to which many others nodded their heads in awe, unable to believe that the person whose name they knew from their school textbooks was now walking towards them. “Why are the children here?” asked Raman upon approaching the children. “They must have come here for a recording,” Ranganath replied with a smile.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Raman stood conversing with the children, Ranganath saw an opportunity to arrange for a lecture by Raman as a token of remembrance of the latter’s visit to the Dharwad station. Raman readily agreed to give the lecture.
          “What topic?” asked Raman. “Sir, you are a Nobel laureate. It does not seem fit for me to suggest a topic for your lecture,” said Ranganath humbly. “OK, I will talk about the colour of flowers.” “At what time is the lecture?” asked Raman. “Sir, it is now 7:10 pm. There is a free slot between 7:50 pm and 8:00 pm.
          I will make alternative arrangements for the program already scheduled to be aired during this slot. Your lecture will be a live broadcast, sir” said Ranganath. “No problem,” replied Raman, setting to prepare himself to speak on the colour of flowers. Radio announcements about Raman’s lecture soon went on air.
          Lakhs of people awaited the live broadcast to begin. Thousands to whom Raman was an inspiration stuck to their radios in anticipation of listening to his lecture. The children expressed their interest to watch Raman speak from the recording room, to which Ranganath readily gave his consent.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ten minutes before the start of the lecture, Raman was escorted into an air-conditioned room with a chair, a table, and a mic mounted on a mic-stand. Raman sat on the chair and placed his turban on the table.
          A sight-to-behold! The kids had their first glimpse of Raman’s bald head with a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sikha" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">shikha</a> (a tiny pony tail-like tuft of hair) at the back. “How long?” asked Raman once more. “Sir, 10 minutes, if you will please,” said Ranganath, humbly requesting Raman to finish the lecture before 8:00 pm as the national news from New Delhi would be broadcasted at sharp 8:00 pm, abruptly cutting off any ongoing program.
          “No problem! No problem!” assured Raman. Saying so, Raman rubbed his hands swiftly and patted on the back of his head near the shikha. “10 minutes! OK, 10 minutes!” said Raman to himself. “Can I start the lecture?” asked Raman. “No sir. Not immediately. I will go on the other side to the recording room and raise my hand as a signal for you to start the lecture.
          At the same time, the red lamp in front of you will glow. You may then start the lecture, sir.” Saying so, Ranganath took leave of Raman and made his way to the recording room. A thick, sound-proof double-door and a clear glass window separated the room in which Raman was seated from the adjoining recording room.
        </p>
        <p>
          Sharp at 7:50 pm, Ranganath raised his hand from the recording room. At the glow of the red lamp, Raman began his lecture with the words, “My dear listener…” and closed his eyes. Listeners from all over the country were enthralled by Raman’s exposition, as were those present in the recording room. “What a good fortune on your part to be listening to this lecture live!” exclaimed Ranganath to the children. Raman continued lecturing keeping his eyes closed.
        </p>
        <p>
          Eight minutes into the lecture, Ranganath began to show signs of worry — the worry of not being able to signal to Raman that a little under two minutes of time is left — because the latter is deeply engrossed in talking <em>with eyes closed</em>.
          Should he open the door to the room in which Raman is seated and wake him up by touch to inform him that only a little under two minutes is left? What if opening the door causes the incoming gush of wind to create a disturbance in the mic? What if the deeply engrossed Raman, upon being touched, stuttered “Uh? What happened?” in the middle of a live broadcast? These thoughts sped through Ranganath’s mind as he stood at the door praying that Raman opened his eyes.
        </p>
        <p>
          Nine minutes and 15 seconds into the lecture, Ranganath was profusely sweating in the air-conditioned recording room. If Raman did not finish his lecture before 8:00 pm, the national news would take over at sharp 8:00 pm, snapping the lecture abruptly.
          Will not the listeners then throw accusations at him for prioritising the broadcasting of national news over a Nobel laureate’s lecture? With these thoughts racing through his mind, Ranganath got ready to push the door and enter the room Raman was seated in. Just then, he heard the words “… that is all my dear listener” from the speaker.
          Raman opened his eyes. The 9 minutes and 40 seconds long and captivating lecture of Raman’s came to an end.
        </p>
        <p>
          Ranganath ran back into the recording room, instructed that the recording be stopped, the connection to the New Delhi station be made, and sped to meet Raman who, after lecturing, looked calm and unfazed like an enlightened man. At once, Ranganath fell at Raman’s feet. “What are you doing? What are you doing?” asked Raman, not sure of what Ranganath was up to.
          “Sir, you almost killed me!” let out Ranganath. “Why, what happened? Why do you look so tensed?” asked Raman with a puzzled face. “Sir, I had requested you to speak for 10 minutes. You closed your eyes at the start. I was unable to find any means to indicate to you the pressing need to finish before 8:00 pm lest your lecture should be taken over by the national news abruptly ending your lecture.” “Why did you worry? I had told my computer 10 minutes!” replied Raman.
        </p>
        <p>
          As Ranganath, the children, and the staff of the recording room listened to these words of Raman’s, they stood dumb-founded!
