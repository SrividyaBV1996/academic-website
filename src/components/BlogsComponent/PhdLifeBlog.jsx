          If you are wondering what is special about the number 1756, the answer is, well, nothing. It is definitely not one of those magical Ramanujan numbers; it is close to the infamous 1729, but still 27 away from it.
          At breakfast today, the 23rd of May 2020, my father started to casually chat with me about what research meant, how a novice Ph.D. student would set foot in the arena of research in the backdrop of many skilled players that had played, some still playing, with little to no spectators to cheer, how a novice Ph.D. student went about discovering new ideas, and so forth.
        </p>
        <p>
          As I began to carefully craft the answers to the array of questions that my father posed at me, I realised soon that I had in front of me not a person who waited patiently for the carefully crafted answers to reach my mouth from my head, a journey that took its own sweet time on rare occasions.
          Instead, I had in front of me a person who extrapolated on sentences that I had barely conceived in my head. I had to grapple with the different pieces of answers that originated in me and came back to me half-digested. Surely, I had no intention of admitting these half-churned pieces back into my head.
          I was determined to put the pieces together and knit them into a convincing answer that could pass through the lone listener’s ears without any obstacles coming in the way.
        </p>
        <p>
          I barely succeeded in answering my father’s questions satisfactorily, or at least that is what I felt. No sooner did the questioning come to an end than I began to ponder how hard I had struggled to put together the words that would make up a good answer – one that my father would listen to without interrupting me mid-way.
          Is coming up with a convincing answer for a properly posed question always this difficult?

          <em>You may be excited to narrate an answer in a manner that seems most befitting to you. An equally excited and inquisitive listener, though, wants the answer to be narrated in a manner that he deems most befitting to his ears.</em>

        <p>
          As I pondered over the above words that instantly arose from deep within the back of my head, or as I felt so, it occurred to me that this is perhaps one of the important lessons I have learnt from the frequent interactions I have had with my peers. Yes.
          Crafting a narrative to fit an individual’s liking is perhaps one of the most underrated capabilities of <em>Homo sapiens</em>.

          <p className="headingFontSize">Other Lessons That Ph.D. Life Has Taught Me</p>
          <p>
            Surely, the life of a researcher, or in my case that of a Ph.D. student, has provided me ample time to turn life experiences into life lessons such as the one above.
            On this day, the 23rd of May 2020, as I step into the 1757th day as a Ph.D. student at the Indian Institute of Science, I am being consumed by the temptation to put down some of the important life lessons I have learnt over the course of the past 1756 days.
            As I write these words, I feel my mind weakening to pick the exact style of narration – one that best suits each and every mind that reads these words. As much as the idea of tailoring a narrative to the liking of an individual seems plausible, the impossibility of tailoring a narrative to the likings of a hundred or million minds is equally glaring.
          </p>
          <p>David Hilbert, a celebrated mathematician of his times, once said,</p>
          <blockquote className="blockquote">
            <p><em>A mathematical theory is not to be considered complete until you have made it so clear that you can explain it to the first man whom you meet on the street.</em></p>
            <cite className="blockquoteCite">David Hilbert, when addressing the 1900 International Congress of Mathematicians in Paris.</cite>
          </blockquote>
          <p>
            But are mathematical ideas supposed to be tailored to common men on the street? Would not a mathematician like Hilbert, upon discovering a new theorem or a proof of it, dare to present it in a manner that makes the result useful to the world at large?
            Is it not imperative that he bring out his unique perspectives on it? I suppose that most of us would answer these questions in the affirmative.
          </p>
          <p>Having said this, without further ado, I present below four life lessons from Ph.D. <em>in the way I have learnt them</em>.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p className="subHeadingFontSize">Good researchers are not necessarily good teachers</p>
          <p>
            Having been exposed to some of the best teachers at school, when I landed in IISc, I had to muster enough courage to see experts failing miserably to connect with amateurs.
            A case that has lasted fresh in my mind is a gruelling lecture, after which the only words I found the students whispering amongst themselves were those of how the lecturer had lost the students to follow the lecture mid-way. However, this is only half the truth.
          </p>
          <p>
            The other half, which I learned later from one-one interactions with some experts, is that experienced researchers often create holes in a lecture or a research discussion purposefully, with an aim of letting the students or their peers fill the holes by themselves.
            The joy of uncovering the missing pieces of a grand puzzle is what drives research forward, after all.
          </p>
          <p>
            In any case, I have come to realise that some researchers are good at generating new ideas but fail miserably at conveying those ideas to others. Some other researchers, although not adept at generating creative ideas, possess the unique ability to disseminate the ideas already on paper to a large audience.
            In the end, each type complements the other. Only a handful of researchers are good at creating and disseminating ideas at the same time.
          </p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p className="subHeadingFontSize">The best researchers store information in their heads in a unique way</p>
          <p>
            This is a lesson that I learnt only when I was half-way into Ph.D.. A distinguishing trait of some of the best researchers with whom I have interacted is their ability to compress and store information in their heads in a form that is readily accessible to them. Let me elaborate.
          </p>
          <p>
            The best researchers, who were once novices like me, learnt the secret art of revisiting the manifold of ideas already present in their heads each time a new piece of information was thrown at them.
            They spent considerable time in figuring out if there are connections between the newly thrown idea and the ones already known to them, and when they did find new connections, they created them as if new neuron-neuron connections were created; if not, the new idea added a new dimension to the already-existing manifolds.
            They would never find themselves at a loss for words when faced with a new question or an idea during a lecture, research presentation or an elevator discussion, thanks to their unique ways of storing and retrieving information from their heads.
          </p>
          <p>The world would be a much better place for researchers if only secret arts such as the one mentioned above get passed on from one generation to the next.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p className="subHeadingFontSize">Quality answers matter, not quick answers</p>
          <p>
            A key component of research life is attending research presentations (or talks, as they are more popularly referred to) from fellow researchers as a means of getting to know the latest happenings.
            During the early years of Ph.D., I could not help but pay attention to the <em>not so important matters that one ought to take away from a research talk</em>: a silent comment that passed through my head about the dressing sense of the speaker, the ease with which even the seemingly novice speakers responded swiftly to questions posed at them, the aesthetics of the presentation slides, etc.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fast forward to the day of my first research talk at ISI Kolkata, a few years later. I knew something had started to bother me from within.
            I had always dressed fairly well, so my dressing sense would clearly not bother me. Was it the fear that I may not be able to respond swiftly to questions thrown at me? Was it the fear that on rare occasions, words would take a long time to traverse my nervous system from my brain to my mouth? <strong>Yes</strong>, definitely.
          </p>
          <p>
            After having presented a little over 10 research <a href="#/talksAndSeminars" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">talks</a>, I learnt that the audience sitting through a research talk does not necessarily seek a quick response always, but certainly seeks a quality response always.
            I learnt that it is perfectly fine to utter the three golden words <em>I don’t know</em>. I learnt that the audience values and sees the amount of thinking and research that has gone behind every word of every response that the speaker crafts.
            I learnt that quick but wrong answers diminish the face value of the speaker.
          </p>
          <p>Clearly enough, I did not see this aspect of a research talk during the early years of Ph.D.</p>
        </div>
        <div>
          <p className="subHeadingFontSize">You may have been a topper all your life, but research may not be your cup of tea</p>
          <p>
            In my interactions with many fellow students at IISc, I have often heard stories about how puzzling it is for students, who at one point in time of their lives had aced through the multitude of exams and tests at school and college, to realise how clueless they find themselves in most lectures at IISc, not having an iota of clue about what the lecturer is saying.
          </p>
          <p>
            The reasons for not following lectures may be aplenty: not having the requisite background, lack of effort from the lecturer’s end towards keeping the students engaged, etc.
            Whatever the reason be, I have learnt that its implications are more important, and one such implication is the self-doubt that leads to questioning oneself about his/her capacity to carry out research, to come up with new ideas that nobody else has been able to come up with, and the likes.
          </p>
          <p>
            I have learnt that research, for what it stands today, is mainly driven by new ways of thinking that have not yet made it to the world.
            Give an apple to Sir Isaac Newton, and he would be more than willing to think about how it attracts the Earth with the same force as it is attracted to Earth, although Earth is perhaps a quintillion times bigger in volume than an apple.
            The theory of gravitation, as we know it today, rests on this key idea which none but Newton <em>saw</em> for the first time. It is a different story that Newton also fared well in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tripos" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Tripos</a> exam during his time.
          </p>
          <p>I have learnt that the willingness to try and fail multiple times is key to surviving in the field of research.</p>

        <p>
          Those are four lessons I have learnt over the course of my Ph.D. life thus far. To those who are eagerly waiting to make a career in research, I hope that the above lessons will serve merely as points to be borne in mind, just as I intended them to be at the time of writing.
          I sincerely wish more and more individuals join the field of research, for I believe that, deep within, each one of us is a researcher on a personal quest – a quest for answers to the various questions that life continually throws at us.
